# Generating-Artistic-images
To generate a new Art Image from a given Regular(your) Image and merging with an Artistic Image using ML and NST. 

Weâ€™re using Neural Style Transfer Algorithm which has 2 important ingredients:
Content Cost Function.
Style Cost Function.

Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.
